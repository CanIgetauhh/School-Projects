        <h1><strong>Reading Rhythms of Sheet Music</strong></h1>
        <h2><strong>Measures and Bar Lines</h2></strong>
        <p>In sheet music, you’ll notice single vertical lines across the music. These  are called bar lines and indicate the end of a measure, which is typically four beats. Occasionally, there are other types of bar lines going down the staff (five horizontal lines) that all serve different purposes and are shown below.</p>

        <h2><strong>Note Lengths</h2></strong>
        <p>The circles inside the staff determine what notes to play, when, and for how long. In order for players to know how long to play a note, they have different appearances and names. Take the whole note in the image for example. It looks like an open oval without a line coming out of it, and it determines that you should play it throughout an entire common measure, or four beats. Every note type after that is half as long as the previous. Also, dots at the end of notes indicates that the note should be played for its full length and half of its length combined.</p>

        <h2><strong>Rests</h2></strong>
        <p>Sometimes you’ll see a portion of the sheet without notes and instead with one of the symbols below. These symbols are called rests, and they do exactly what their name says, rest and stop playing. The different rest symbols correlate to different amounts of time resting, also listed below. Rests can be dotted like notes, to make the amount of time to rest extended by and and a half times the original amount. Lastly, if multiple rests are next to each other, you just combine their lengths and rest for that amount of time.</p>

        <h2><strong>Time Signature</strong></h2>
        <p>At the beginning of a piece of music, the time signature will be listed as a number over another number. A top number represents how many beats are in a measure and the bottom number to what length of time a beat correlates to. For example for the top number, a 4 equals that there will be four beats every measure of music, which is most common, and a 6 means there will be 6 beats. For the bottom number, a 1 means one beat is equal to one whole note, and a four means a quarter note is equal to one beat, which is also the most common. If a sheet music uses the usual 4/4 time signature, it is sometimes written as C, or common time. If there is a C with a vertical slash down the center, it means a time signature of 2/2, or 2 beats of half notes every measure, and is called cut time.</p>

        <h2><strong>Articulations, Ties, and Slurs</strong></h2>
        <p>Sometimes a note’s length or the way it’s played needs to be really specific. Whenever this is the case, a symbol is placed over/under the note. The symbols make good sense once you see what they mean, because they illustrate in the symbol how they should be played. For the accent, you follow the symbol in volume, starting loud and ending softer. For the marcato, you should basically just play loud instead of letting off. Now for the ones representing length, a flat line, or tenuto, means to play a note until the very edge into the next note/rest. To play a dot under a note, or staccato, you play the note for a short time, but be careful not to also play loud like a marcato. Also, if you see a long line connecting two notes, it means to tie the notes together if they’re the same tone or slur them together if they’re different tones. There are many other articulations, but these are the basic ones.</p>
